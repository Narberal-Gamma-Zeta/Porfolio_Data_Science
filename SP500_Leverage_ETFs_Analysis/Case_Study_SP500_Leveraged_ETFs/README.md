# Case Study:S&P 500 Leveraged ETFs

Investing in leveraged ETFs over extended periods sparks debates, with concerns about daily rebalancing causing losses in the short term. Yet, a market's long-term positive bias offsets this, favoring upward trends. Similarly, while lump-sum investments in leveraged ETFs during market declines may lead to slow recovery, dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount at intervals, mitigates risks. This analysis reveals that 2x and 3x leveraged S&P 500 ETFs outperform non-leveraged ones, but they also come with higher volatility. Leveraged ETFs did not exist at the creation of the S&P 500. Hence due to the absence of historical data on leveraged ETFs. In this analysis, the leveraged ETFs price are obtained via median leverage from SSO and UPRO, which are 2x S&P 500 and 3x S&P 500 leveraged ETFs respectively. SSO started trading in 2006 and UPRO started trading in 2009.Although not exact, it provides a close estimate. The analysis concludes that 3x ETFs offer the highest returns and volatility, 2x ETFs strike a balance, and 1x ETFs ensure lower volatility with albeit, the lowest return.
