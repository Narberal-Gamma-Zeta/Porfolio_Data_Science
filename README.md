## Data Analysis on Leveraged S&P 500 ETF's
### Case Study:S&P 500 Leveraged ETFs

This analysis debates the merits of long-term investing in leveraged ETFs, highlighting concerns about short-term losses due to daily rebalancing but emphasizing the offsetting positive market bias. The study concludes that while 3x ETFs offer higher returns and volatility, 2x ETFs strike a balance, and 1x ETFs provide lower volatility and return.

### Neural Network: S&P 500 Leveraged ETFs Prices

A neural network approximates daily leverage for 2x SSO and 3x UPRO ETFs using S&P 500 percentage changes, validated by median squared error. While SSO 2x ETF prices are effectively simulated, UPRO's prediction accuracy requires further improvement, as evident in plotted comparisons of predicted and median leveraged ETF prices.
